        <h2>Canal Structure</h2>
        <p>Canal alignment is the location of the center line of canal in plan and fixing it on the ground.
            Therefore alignment should have given more concentration while fixing it.
         <br/>It should be done in such a way that it should irrigates maximum area. The length of canal should be minimum
        as shorter the length means head loss is less and smaller loss of discharge.
    <br/>The alignment should be such that it has minimum cross drainage work and it should be such that cutting and filling of soil will balance.</p>
   <p><br/>The canal do not have any head works for the purpose of diversion of the river water.
        They get water through the open cuts in the bank of river.they are called as Head.
        <br/>In the down stream of the canal at about the distance of 5 to 6 <strong>kms</strong>.the regulator is provided from the point of <strong>heads</strong>,to control the water supply.
        large number of cross drainage work is required. it is large capacity canal getting the supply of water directly from the river.
        it has a large capacity of supply waterto the major distributs and large canal.they are generally not use to make direct suppy of water to the agricultural field.
